        <h1 style="text-align: center">How to take proper care of your hair</h1>
        <p>
            <center>
            <h3>1. Regular Washing:</h3>

            Wash your hair regularly to remove dirt, oil, and product buildup. The frequency of washing can vary based on your hair type (e.g., oily, dry, normal).
            <br>Use a Gentle Shampoo and Conditioner:
            
            Choose a shampoo and conditioner that suits your hair type. Use sulfate-free and moisturizing products to prevent excessive dryness.

            <h3>2. Avoid Hot Water:</h3>
            
            Wash your hair with lukewarm or cool water. Hot water can strip the hair of its natural oils, leading to dryness and potential damage.
            
            <h3>3. Deep Conditioning:</h3>
            
            Incorporate deep conditioning treatments into your routine to provide extra moisture to your hair. <br>You can use store-bought deep conditioners or try natural remedies like coconut oil or olive oil.
            
            <h3>4. Protect Your Hair from Heat:</h3>
            
            Minimize the use of heat-styling tools such as flat irons, curling irons, and blow dryers. <br>When using them, use a heat protectant spray to reduce damage.
            
            <h3>5. Avoid Tight Hairstyles:</h3>
            
            Tight hairstyles, such as ponytails or braids, can cause stress on the hair shaft and lead to breakage. <br>Opt for looser styles to prevent unnecessary tension.
            
            <h3>6. Trim Regularly:</h3>
            
            Get regular haircuts or trims to remove split ends and prevent them from traveling up the hair shaft. This promotes healthier hair growth.
            
            <h3>7. Protect Hair from the Sun:</h3>
            
            Sun exposure can damage hair, so wear a hat or use products with UV protection when spending extended periods in the sun.
            
            <h3>8. Balanced Diet:</h3>
            
            Eat a well-balanced diet rich in vitamins and minerals, especially those that promote hair health, such as biotin, vitamin E, and omega-3 fatty acids.
            
            <h3>9. Stay Hydrated:</h3>
            
            Drink enough water to keep your body and hair hydrated. Dehydration can contribute to dry and brittle hair.
            
            <h3>10. Gentle Towel Drying:</h3>
            
            Pat your hair dry with a soft towel rather than rubbing vigorously, as wet hair is more prone to breakage.
            
            <h3>11. Use a Wide-Tooth Comb:</h3>
            
            Detangle your hair with a wide-tooth comb, starting from the tips and working your way up to prevent breakage.
            
            <h3>12. Limit Chemical Treatments:</h3>
            
            Reduce the frequency of chemical treatments such as coloring, perming, or relaxing, as these can weaken the hair structure.
            
            <h3>13. Manage Stress:</h3>
            
            Stress can contribute to hair loss, so practice stress-reducing techniques such as meditation or exercise.
